# numeric-cpp
numeric-cpp is a library of numeric functions implemented in cpp using only static allocation.
The goal is to provide a library of mathematical solutions (e.q. linear equations, interpolation, numeric integration)
that can be e.q. used on micro controllers.
If one deletes the .print() and .input() functions (which were provided to make debugging easier) 
this lib is not using any c++ standard library.
